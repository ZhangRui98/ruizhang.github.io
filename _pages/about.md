I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate at Zhejiang University supervised by Jian Liu and Qingbiao Wu. I am working on machine learning security and privacy. I am concerned about watermarking and fingerprinting schemes, federated clustering methods, and machine learning models robustness against adversarial examples. Now I am a visiting student in University of Waterloo supervised by Prof. N. Asokan.
